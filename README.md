## Iterator pattern
#### like browser histroty when you go to previews url of next url
#### Single Responsibility Principle: Itâ€™s really easy to extract the huge algorithms into separate classes in the Iterator method.
#### Open/Closed Principle: Passing the new iterators and collections into the client code does not break the code can easily be installed into it.
#### Easy to use Interface: It makes the interface really simple to use and also supports the variations in the traversal of the collections.
